                <h3>To use this app:
                    Click on "Create a Room" to create a new blank canvas to draw on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Remember to keep track of the "Room" under the eraser button, you'll need this to 
                    rejoin the room later or to share with your friends. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Click on "Join a Room" with a room token of your choice to go see what your friends have drawn!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You are able to draw on top of the existing drawing and then save it and your friends will see
                    what you have drawn on top of their work when they return to the room.
